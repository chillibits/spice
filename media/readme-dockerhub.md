This is the home repo of the Spice programming language. Spice is a compiled language which sets a focus on performance and practicality. It is considered as a systems language, which means it is neither suitable for coding user interfaces nor any interface with the user, except cli tools. Spice supports cross-compilation to all target platforms, listed below.
