Spice is a compiled language which sets a focus on performance and practicality. It is considered as a systems language,
which means that is rather not suitable for coding user interfaces, but for coding drivers and cli tools. Spice has
support for cross-compiling for multiple target platforms. In order to get started, visit the
[installation guide](../install/linux.md).
