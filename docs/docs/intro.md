# Introduction
Spice is a compiled language which sets a focus on performance and practicality. It is considered as a systems language, which means that is rather not suitable for coding user interfaces, but for coding drivers and cli tools. Spice has support for cross-compiling for multiple target platforms. In order to get started, visit our [quick-start guide](../quick-start).
