[Warning] ./test-files/typechecker/warnings/error-async-capture-rule-2/source.spice:4:16: Lambda violates async lambda capture rules: Async lambdas can only capture one pointer by value without storing captures in the caller stack frame, which can lead to bugs due to references, outliving the validity scope of the referenced variable.
